Hi everyone, I'm Sandro.
Currently studying Software Engineering (Ingeniería Informática) at 'Universidad Católica Andrés Bello' in Caracas, Venezuela.

I have been interested on the digital world and its capabilities on any field. Always wanted to study something related to astronomy/astrophysics... maybe on a short term future I'll specialize 
on this field for my career.

Not so extroverted, not so introverted. More like, an ambiverted guy that gains trust on people as I know them. 
I like videogames, sometimes I draw (for fun), I practice mechanography. I like math and numbers, I like to think I am quite good at it, fast learner. I am one with science, anything related to science peeks my attention a lot.
